## The "Silver Tsunami" 

The Pewlwett-Hackard leadership has discovered that many of their thousands of employees will become retriement elgible and potentially leaving the company.  They have tasked the HR department to convert the antiquated excel databases to SQL to 1. upgrade the system and 2. get a better picture of their personnel.  From this upgrade they are requesting how many and who, in particular, may be retiring or eligible for a retirement package and a list of potential employees for a new mentorship program

## Results: 

Pewlett-Hackard had six original database (.CSV) files that we used to build an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to show the relationship between each file.

Through the use of the ERD we were able to see the repationships and build the files necessary to answer the leaderships requirments.

Our analysis of the number of retiring employees show that:

    1. 90k+ staff members are retirement eligible
    2. 64% of those retiring are Senior Staff
    3. Half of those (45k) are our engineers 
    4. Found a potential 1.9k that would be eligible for the Mentorship program

## Summary:

      o How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?  It was determined that 90,398 employees will retire or become retirement eligible in the next few years.  Those employees are broken down in the picture below that depicts the 7 roles they fulfill.

     o There could be a potential knowledge pitfall due to the loss of so many senior staff members.
  
     o Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  There are over 1900 employees in the pool of eligible candidates to become mentors for the next generation of employees.
